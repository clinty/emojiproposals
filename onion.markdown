# Introduction

With a history of several thousand years of human consumption and use,
onions have been featured in recipes, writings, and art worldwide.
Onions are available in a number of forms and varieties.  In addition
to being recognizable culinarily, onions are also known for making people
cry.[0]

# Names

CLDR short name: onion  
CLDR keywords: onion, food, allium

# Selection Factors Inclusion

## Compatibility

While there have been many requests for a onion emoji, most popular
messaging services have not included a onion emoji yet. This proposal
seeks to rectify that.

## Expected Usage Level

### Frequency

We expect use of the onion emoji to be high globally, as onion is
found in cuisines throughout the world.

### Multiple Usages

The onion emoji would be used heavily by food-eaters, chefs,
and people using metaphors about crying.  It could be used in
combination with other emoji to express a variety of prepared
dishes.

Onions are believed to have health benefits, such as reducing
or healing inflammation, and preventing cancer.

They are the subject of figures of speech such as "peeling back
the onion", "know your onions", « mêle-toi de tes oignons »,

In computer networking, onion routing is a technique for anonymous
communication over a computer network. In an onion network, messages
are encapsulated in layers of encryption, analogous to layers of an
onion. The encrypted data is transmitted through a series of network
nodes called onion routers, each of which "peels" away a single layer,
uncovering the data's next destination. When the final layer is
decrypted, the message arrives at its destination. The sender remains
anonymous because each intermediary knows only the location of the
immediately preceding and following nodes.[1]

### Use in Sequences

cheese and onion pie: CHEESE WEDGE, ONION, PIE

French onion soup: FRANCE, ONION, POT OF FOOD

onion bread: ONION, BREAD

## Image Distinctiveness

Bulb onions are instantly recognizable.

## Completeness

Onion represents a major category of culinary and cultural
experience which is not represented in the current emoji list.

## Frequently Requested

Twitter is full of people with various levels of outrage
at the lack of onion emoji.

# Selection Factors Exclusion

## Overly Specific

While there are many delicious members of the Allium genus,
none are currently represented in emoji.

## Open Ended

If onion should open the floodgates to other edible plant
bulbs, there are not that many.

## Already Representable

Given that people are using the text "onion emoji" and
the emoji CHESTNUT paired with an explanation that it is
meant to be onion and not a chestnut, or the emoji CHESTNUT plus the
emoji SEEDLING, it seems that there is no good way of representing
onion in lieu of an actual onion codepoint.

## Transient

The onion has existed for thousands of years.  It is in many, many
recipes.  The human race shows no signs of being ready to abandon
it.

## Logos, brands, UI icons, signage, specific people, deities

Onions are featured in many logos, brands, and trademarks.  Several
types of onion enjoy Protected Geographical Status in Europe.  However,
it would be absurd for onion itself to be the victim of intellectual
property restrictions.
