# Introduction

With a history of several thousand years of human consumption and use,
garlic is native to Central Asia and northeastern Iran, and has long
been a common seasoning worldwide.  It was known to Ancient Egyptians,
and has been used both as a food flavoring and as a traditional
medicine.[0]

Garlic is known worldwide by its unique odor and flavor. It is sometimes
called the stinking rose even though it is a member of the lily family.

It is high in fructans, allyl methyl sulfide, vitamin Bâ‚†, and deliciousness.

There are restaurants, competitions and festivals, websites, books, and
songs dedicated to garlic.  It is featured in writings from past millennia.
It has been claimed that garlic juice can [reduce the power of magnets][1].

# Names

CLDR short name: garlic  
CLDR keywords: garlic, food, allium

# Selection Factors Inclusion

## Compatibility

While there have been many requests for a garlic emoji, most popular
messaging services have not included a garlic emoji yet. This proposal
seeks to rectify that.

## Expected Usage Level

### Frequency

We expect use of the garlic emoji to be high globally, as garlic is
found in cuisines throughout the world, said to have myriad health
benefits, and has significance in many aspects of culture.

### Multiple Usages

The garlic emoji would be used heavily by food-eaters, chefs,
and vampire enthusiasts.  It could be used in combination with
other emoji to express a variety of prepared dishes.

In computer networking, garlic routing is a variant of onion routing
that encrypts multiple messages together to make it more difficult for
attackers to perform traffic analysis and to increase the speed of
data transfer.[2]

There is also no shortage of tweets with the hashtag #garlicemoji.

# Selection Factors Exclusion

## Overly Specific

While there are many delicious members of the Allium genus,
none are currently represented in emoji, and were any others
to exist, neither the onion nor the shallot nor the leek
nor the scallion nor the chive nor the inimitable ramp would
be an adequate stand-in for the glorious garlic.

## Open Ended

If garlic should open the floodgates to other edible plant
bulbs, there are not that many.

## Already Representable

Given that people are using the text "garlic emoji" and
the emoji CHESTNUT paired with an explanation that it is
meant to be garlic and not a chestnut, it seems that there is no good
way of representing garlic in lieu of an actual garlic codepoint.

## Transient

Garlic has existed for thousands of years.  It is the subject of
countless recurring festivals.  It shows no outward signs of growing
weary of this attention.

## Logos, brands, UI icons, signage, specific people, deities

Garlic is featured in many logos, brands, and trademarks.  Several
types of garlic enjoy Protected Geographical Status in Europe.  However,
it would be absurd for garlic itself to be the victim of intellectual
property restrictions.
